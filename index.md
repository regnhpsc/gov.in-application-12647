# GitHub Pages Setup Guide for Admit Card

## Files You Need to Upload

You need to upload these 3 files to your GitHub repository:

1. **index.html** - The main admit card page
2. **candidate-photo.jpg** - Your passport photo
3. **README.md** - Instructions file (optional)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and log in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Name it something like: `admit-card` or `my-admit-card`
5. Make sure it's set to **Public**
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. In your new repository, click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
2. Drag and drop these files:
   - The `index.html` file (provided below)
   - Your passport-sized photo (rename it to `candidate-photo.jpg`)
3. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, click **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **"main"** branch
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Access Your Webpage
Your admit card will be live at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME/
```

For example: `https://johnsmith.github.io/admit-card/`

## Important Notes

### Photo Requirements
- Your photo MUST be named exactly: `candidate-photo.jpg`
- Recommended size: 3.5cm x 4.5cm (passport size)
- Format: JPG or JPEG
- Make sure it's a clear, recent photo with white/light background

### If Photo Doesn't Show
If you don't have the photo file ready, the admit card will show a broken image icon. Upload `candidate-photo.jpg` later to fix this.

### Updating Information
To change any details (name, roll number, etc.):
1. Click on `index.html` in your repository
2. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit)
3. Make your changes
4. Click **"Commit changes"**
5. Your webpage updates automatically in 1-2 minutes
